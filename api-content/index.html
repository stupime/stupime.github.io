To fight back, I made up my mind to eat a deal alone at midnight. I promise this is not the excuse for me to eat at midnight.Yes, I just want to revenge. The most common stall at night food court is definitely skewers. Among all the dishes, roast chicken is my favorite. The crispy skin, tender chicken as well as fragrant gravy could always make my day. After eating and sending my photos to my best friend, I feel extremely more than delightful and decide to come again tomorrow.

When it comes to Hunan Cuisine, spicy is the most intuitive feeling. Just as above images show, several dishes maybe sour or salty, but all of them are spicy. We enjoyed the spicy flavor with mouth swollen, but no one would like to escape since we're kind of addicted to this contradictory feeling. Maybe we just want to set ourselves free before the end of the holiday and afterwards we could pretend that we're normal.

We chose one restaurant which has great reputation for Shanghai Cuisine. My favorite dish is the drunken chicken roll. Just as its name says, this dish uses liquor as the fundamental condiment to soak and stew the chicken which could help remove the fishy smell and adds its flavor and freshness. Good drunken chicken roll will not exude too much taste of alcohol but mainly the fragrance of the chicken. To my sadness, the restaurant we tried this time failed on this dish.

This restaurant is most famous for its Marinated bones which is a very hardcore dish. After marination and stewing, the meat on the bone becomes so tender that it's easy to peel off and chew up. In addition to this dish, we also had kebab, chicken soup and several other dishes. We all feel contented in the end and plan to come again later!

We ordered almost all his favorite food, like sausages, sleeve-fish as well as the prawns. Since he can't eat the spicy food, we finally chose tomato pot and soup pot to boil up the food. The waiters are extremely enthusiastic and considerate. We had a really great time at HaiDiLao.

Specifically, I want to use image analysis for disease analysis and video analysis for patient movement supervision to help take off some burdens from physicians/nurses. (Compared to classic cv problems, I think this research direction has more direct benefits in real life.) what expect to learn, most appealing aspect in this project finish the project requirements and produce some valuable results, find the important problem and existing solutions in this field. plan of further study, career goal: in short term, i hope to produce some results in this summer.If possible, I wish I could continue my research in your lab and try to publish one valuable paper in my final year. in the long run, i want to pursue a phd degree and become a researcher. what you have learnt in the past: research experience, technical skills(ML, Data Structure) konwledge: basic ai fundamental course, ml course, currently taking rl course, basic math, have to admit im just a beginner level, but i'd like to learn and i have the determination and persistence to make up what i lacked before the start of our research i totally have two research experiences: the first one is in my first year's summer. The topic is encode method to make message correctly transfered in noisy channel. My main work is to use matlab to test performance of the methods and visualize them. My second experience is about layout decomposition probelm in circuit design. The problem could be mapped to a complex version of coloring problem. In theoretical level, I together with a postgraduate student revisited one famous paper in that filed, we modified the cost function and fixed some fault in the algorithm. in programming, we added some new features to a existing framework. And we're cunrrently preparing for submission to a conference. your questions: sell your knowledge from reading on this specific field.data, could you please recommend some readings which're must knows for this project? will i supervised by phd? i noticed that there exists 3 tasks, is it for our selection or we need to finish all the three task by oneself. for the third task in the description, extend our developped RL framework to help surgical decision making, does the framework refers to that one in your paper RL and tree search? if so is our task to optimize this framework or apply it to the decision problem?
