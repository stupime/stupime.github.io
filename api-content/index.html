{"posts":[{"title":"insomnia raving","content":" Life is like a dream, u're always asleep, so dont consider insomnia. When u think u cant fall asleep, indeed u're in such a deep sleep mode that u mistake u're awake. What prevent u from having a good sleep, are not solely the noisy surroundings, but the cliche that u must sleep for at least 7 hrs every day without any break to obtain a high sleep quality. Do what u need to do, but dont be anxious about it. The so-called insomia is never that u feel like u didnt fall asleep yesterday, but the situation that u feel powerless tmr due to lack of sleep. be obtuse, be slow The reasons for insomnia lie in that u failed to concentrate on the sleep, which doesnt mean u should keep urself highly nervous and struggle to fall sleep but think nothing but it's time to sleep. In short, dont distract urself from falling asleep. One thing at one time. One common distraction is the electronics. However, the problem is not electronics themselves, instead caused by the notifications and curiousity about news, friends' moments, etc. ","link":"https://stupime.github.io/post/insomnia-raving/"},{"title":"Plan","content":"Deadlines: 3.25 3007 chap 5 online test 3.30 3007 lab 4 4.8 10:30 am 2007 lab report &amp;
